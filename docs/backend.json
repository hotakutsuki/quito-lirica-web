    "reasoning": "Given the requirement to store presentation requests, a straightforward collection structure is recommended. A single collection, `presentationRequests`, will house all request documents. This simplifies data management and querying.  \n\nAuthorization Independence: Since there are no hierarchical relationships or nested data, authorization is simple: there's no need to denormalize any data for authorization purposes. All writes are public (no login required). The structure facilitates QAPs since listing presentation requests will have the same security posture for all documents in the collection. This prevents listing documents that should be hidden.\n\nClarity of Intent:  The collection name `presentationRequests` clearly indicates its purpose. Each document within the collection represents a single presentation request, making the structure easy to understand and maintain."
